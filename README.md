     Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA: Reduce data dimension using the PCA algorithm from sklearn.
     Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-Means: Predict clusters using the cryptocurrencies data using the KMeans algorithm from sklearn.
     Vsualizing Results: Create some plots and data tables to present the results.
